# fisher-lm-srilm

The notebook in this repository documents the use of [`SRILM`](http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/manpages/) to construct an add-1 smoothed unigram model based on the Fisher corpus. It exists principally because [`kenlm`](https://github.com/kpu/kenlm) categorically does not calculate unigram models.

The variation in models tested here is more documentation of SRILM options/use than meaningful testing. (Especially in light of how little variation there is in the test set results.)
